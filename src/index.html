							<h3>Who is Ron Balicki?</h3>
							<p>"Wrong Ron" covered the game for more than 30 years, from the Masters to elite amateur events to the college game. Balicki is the only media member inducted into the GCAA Hall of Fame. Many credit the growing popularity of college golf to Balicki's passion for covering the game.

							<h3>What is this award?</h3>
							<p>Many scholarships are awarded for those that take the course in college, but not many reward those that bring the rounds to life through words, photos and videos. This award will act as a scholarship for a young writer that is dedicated to the journalism that Balicki dedicated himself to for decades.
